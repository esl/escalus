# Escalus [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/esl/escalus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/esl/escalus)

Escalus is an Erlang XMPP client library.
It began as a tool for convenient testing of XMPP servers,
but can also be used as a standalone Erlang application.

Escalus is aimed at checking correctness of XMPP server behaviour,
in contrast to tools such as Tsung which are about stress testing
and don't verify correctness.


# Quick start

Read the [the intro file](docs/intro.md) to get started.


# Standalone Escalus application

If you're interested in using Escalus as a standalone Erlang XMPP client
library (without any reliance on Common Test),
then see [standalone usage prerequisites](docs/standalone.md).
